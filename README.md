# statistical_learning_method
Some implementation of the book of statistical learning method by lihang

1. implementation of linear classification method perceptron, 
including the stochastic gradient descent and show the change of the hyperplane, 
2-D case, w is initialized to [1, 1], b is 1

Problem:
1. The result will be different if we change the order of the data points when checking whether a point is classified right or wrong

Converge:
1. Convergence can be guaranteed when the dataset is linearly separable


2. implementation of kdtree creation and find nearest neighbor code
TODO:
1. find k nearest neighbor code
